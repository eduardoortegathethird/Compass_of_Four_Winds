# Compass_of_Four_Winds
The Compass of the Four Winds is an interactive piece designed to invite contemplation by asking questions. The four answers given by the central compass are North (No), South (Maybe), East (Wait), and West (Yes). Each direction also has a totem animal and color associated with it. Around the central compass there are four thrones for rest and reflection on your question and the Four Windsâ€™ answer.
